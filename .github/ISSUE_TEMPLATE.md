## Simple Summary
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."
Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SEG.

## Abstract
A short description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation
The motivation is critical for SEGs as they change overall industry standards.
It should clearly explain why the existing process is inadequate to address the problem
that the SEG solves as well as how the SEG is in line with community goals.

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new process.
The specification should be detailed enough to allow any member to add the process to our documentation.

## Backwards Compatibility (optional)
All SEGs that introduce modify existing processes must include a section
describing these changes and their impacts on overall processes.
