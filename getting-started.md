# Getting Started

## Planning a New Project

Start with writing a [System Description Document](project-planning/system-description.md). The [Development Plan](project-planning/development-plan.md) and [Preliminary Audit](project-planning/preliminary-audit.md) are optional components but quite valuable for new development teams.

## Auditing Existing Code

If you already have code and your auditor sent you here. Create a [System Description](project-planning/system-description.md), then jump down to [Software Requirements](development/software-requirements/), and finish up with an [Audit Prep Report](security-audit/audit-prep-report.md).
