# Initial Audit

An Initial Audit is a short \(2-4 hours\) meeting with the Developers and the Auditor or another experienced Developer. You present the System Description and the Development Plan and the offers improvements.  


## When should an Initial Audit take place

Ideally the initial audit should take place before development begins.  This audit is much more important to new organizations where the successful deployment is still new to the organization. It will give you an experienced opinion on the schedule, resources, deliverables and expectations for a successful deployment.

## Questions that Should be Answered at the Meeting

What kind of expertise will be needed and where?

Is the schedule reasonable?

Are these the best tools and language for this development?

What should be on chain, what off chain?

When should the audit\(s\) take place?

What deliverables should the auditor expect?

Is the test plan complete enough?

Is the Beta deployment plan reasonable?

Have I allowed off ramps that cap my risks?
