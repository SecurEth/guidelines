# Development Plan

The Initial Plan says what you want to do before you do it.  You can present this plan, with the [System Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19iwgv3oZeB0FYL5VRZvVq9i_PIffnZc0NGEFDV3w1v4/edit#bookmark=id.wz81og6mly1y) to an auditor or for an [initial audit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/196RBRz1ur93czAoBOrdPq7ZgxTudDTpUsiNIL5PBkZw/edit#bookmark=id.kv3w2x7mf27c).  The idea is to get critical feedback before the main work begins.
