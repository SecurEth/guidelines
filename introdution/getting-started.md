# Getting Started

## About the Guidelines

These guidelines are a community resource. They are meant to help guide and inform you through your development process and ensure the highest quality results in your smart contract system and your end product.

The Guidelines are constantly evolving with expert feedback. All suggestions made here are managed by expert members of our community, who have experience with the best practices and common pitfalls of secure smart contract development. Their wisdom is meant to help you on your journey

## Planning a New Project

The [Development Plan](../project-planning/development-plan.md) and [Initial Audit](../project-planning/initial-audit.md) are optional components but quite valuable for new development teams.

## Preparing for an Audit

If you already have code and your auditor sent you here. Create a [System Description](../project-planning/system-description.md), then jump down to [Software Requirements](../development/software-requirements.md).

## Reading the Guidelines

Each article is designed to read on its own, with a consistent style \(Who, What, Why, etc\).

## Giving Feedback

We encourage feedback. This is just getting started and we want to be sure we are meeting peoples needs. At a minimum, please hit one of the happy/sad faces.

For a more detailed response, please report an [issue ](https://github.com/SecurEth/guidelines/issues/new)on our GitHub.
