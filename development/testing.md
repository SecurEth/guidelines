# Testing

## What is Testing?

If you've written software, you've probably done testing before, and you could probably give a pretty good response to the question posed above. A very naive answer to the question is that "Testing proves you did the right thing", but then you would have to define what "the right thing" is. A formal definition for testing often defines two categories of testing: Verification and Validation. [Barry Boehm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Boehm) has a widely copied quote that explains this distinction:

> * Validation: Are we building the right product?
> * Verification: Are we building the product right?
