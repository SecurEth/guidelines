# DNS Example

## Requirements Specification  <a id="docs-internal-guid-9d3cc77f-0456-331f-7125-1385d39651a5"></a>

\(derived from SDD/Goals\):

1. The DNS contract shall allow any user to register a name that has not already been registered to another owner. \(`sha256[:3]` is c84d\)
2. The DNS contract shall reject any request to register a name that is already registered to another user. \(`sha256[:3]` is 35a4\)
3. The DNS contract shall allow the owner of a domain to change the resolved address. \(`sha256[:3]` is e532\)
4. The DNS contract shall allow anyone to perform a lookup of a registered domainâ€™s resolved address. \(`sha256[:3]` is fffc\)

## Implementation:  <a id="docs-internal-guid-bc5fbce9-0457-3f17-6421-28ed7079afd5"></a>
