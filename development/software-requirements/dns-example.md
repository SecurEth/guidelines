# DNS Example



### Requirements Specification {#docs-internal-guid-9d3cc77f-0456-331f-7125-1385d39651a5}

\(derived from SDD/Goals\):

1. The DNS contract shall allow any user to register a name that has not already been registered to another owner. \(sha256\[:3\] is c84d\)
2. The DNS contract shall reject any request to register a name that is already registered to another user. \(sha256\[:3\] is 35a4\)
3. The DNS contract shall allow the owner of a domain to change the resolved address. \(sha256\[:3\] is e532\)
4. The DNS contract shall allow anyone to perform a lookup of a registered domainâ€™s resolved address. \(sha256\[:3\] is fffc\)

### Implementation: {#docs-internal-guid-bc5fbce9-0457-3f17-6421-28ed7079afd5}
