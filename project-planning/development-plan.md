# Development Plan

## Why do a Development Plan?

The Development Plan says what you want to do before you do it. You can present this plan with the [System Description](system-description.md) to an auditor or for a [Preliminary Audit](preliminary-audit.md). The idea is to get critical feedback.

## What is included in a Development Plan?

1. Describe the team and their expertise
2. Define the language \(Solidity/Viper/Flint etc.\), libraries, tools
3. How will you structure the contracts?
4. How much on chain, how much off?
5. What is your test plan?
6. How long do you expect the development to last?
7. Deployment Phases \(Truffle, Rinkeby, MainNet Beta, Final MainNet Release\)
8. Audit Phases \(How many audits and in when?\)
