# Development Plan

## Why do a Development Plan?

An Development Plan says from a development perspective, how you are going to develop, test, audit and deploy your smart contracts. It is a very top level document that shows you have thought through the whole development process.

## What is included in a Development Plan?

1. Describe the team and their expertise
2. Define the language \(Solidity/Viper/Flint etc.\), libraries, tools
3. How will you structure the contracts?
4. How much on chain, how much off?
5. What is your test plan?
6. How long do you expect the development to last?
7. Deployment Phases \(Truffle, Rinkeby, MainNet Beta, Final MainNet Release\)
8. Audit Phases \(How many audits and in when?\)
