# System Description Tiny - DNS
## Idea: Decentralized DNS!

This program exists as a very small example off this documentation process.  It will exist on test chains only.  
It is not designed for deployment to the mainnet.  This contract has no tokens.
### Goal(s):
* Allow a user to register a domain name to resolve to a specific address
* Anyone can perform a lookup of that domainâ€™s resolved address
