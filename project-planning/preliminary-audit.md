# Preliminary Audit

A Preliminary Audit is a video or in-person meeting with the auditor. This audit is much more important to new organizations where the successful deployment is still new to the organization. It will give you an experienced opinion on the schedule, resources, deliverables and expectations for a successful deployment.

## When should an Preliminary Audit take place? {#docs-internal-guid-038fb17c-fb24-a5d8-fdb3-368d9c8b1367}

Preliminary audit should take place after initial architecture is complete, but before development begins.

[System Description](system-description.md) and [Development Plan](development-plan.md) should be sent to the auditor in advance.

## Content Discussed at the Meeting

The discussion should follow the points in the [Development Plan](development-plan.md). The intent is to validate the plan as reasonable and achievable. If not, the auditor should discuss improvements.
