# Preliminary Audit

## When should an Preliminary Audit take place {#docs-internal-guid-038fb17c-fb24-a5d8-fdb3-368d9c8b1367}

Preliminary audit should take place before development begins. This audit is much more important to new organizations where the successful deployment is still new to the organization. It will give you an experienced opinion on the schedule, resources, deliverables and expectations for a successful deployment.

## Content Discussed at the Meeting

The discussion should follow the points in the [Development Plan](development-plan.md). The content in the Dev plan should be discussed with the auditor. The intent is to validate the plan as reasonable and achievable.  If not, the auditor should discuss improvements.
