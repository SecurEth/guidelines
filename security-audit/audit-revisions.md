# Audit Revisions

Audits may have multiple rounds of revisions

Important to maintain clear versioning information and explain in detail how updates were performed

Communicate with auditor to resolve all revisions

Sometimes revision suggestions are not actionable or practical to implement. Explain why. Comment if you plan on implementing non-critical suggestions in a future release.
