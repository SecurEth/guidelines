## What is Code Coverage?

Explain what code coverage means

{% embed data="{\"url\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code\_coverage\",\"type\":\"link\",\"title\":\"Code coverage\",\"description\":\"In computer science, test coverage is a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite runs. A program with high test coverage, measured as a percentage, has had more of its source code executed during testing, which suggests it has a lower chance of containing undetected software bugs compared to a program with low test coverage. Many different metrics can be used to calculate test coverage; some of the most basic are the percentage of program subroutines and the percentage of program statements called during execution of the test suite.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png\",\"aspectRatio\":0}}" %}

There's like 13 different types of code coverage. Read about them.
